Assignment description:

Refer to this simple code https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-xwX32O0WYOqcCROJnnJiSdzScPCudAM?usp=sharing: Rewrite this code, but this time remove the RNN and add LSTM. 
Refer to this file https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12Pciev6dvYBJ7KxwSHruG-XMwcoj0SfJ. 
The questions this time are already mentioned in the file. Take as much time as you want (but less than 7 days), to solve the file. Once you are done, then write your solutions in the quiz. 
Please note that the Session 4 Assignment Solution will time out after 15 minutes, as you just have to copy-paste your answers

Solution:

Refer to END2_Session_4_reference_original.ipynb

The END2_Session_4_reference_original.ipynb contains RNN architecture. It is rewritten by removing RNN and replacing it with LSTM and uploaded as END2_Session_4_RNN_to_LSTM.ipynb
